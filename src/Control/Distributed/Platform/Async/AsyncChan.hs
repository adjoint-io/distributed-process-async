-- This module provides a set of operations for spawning Process operations
-- and waiting for their results.  It is a thin layer over the basic
-- concurrency operations provided by "Control.Distributed.Process".
-- The main feature it provides is a pre-canned set of APIs for waiting on the
-- result of one or more asynchronously running (and potentially distributed)
-- processes.

-- | Private channel used to synchronise task results
type InternalChannel a = (SendPort (AsyncResult a), ReceivePort (AsyncResult a))

-- | A handle for an asynchronous action spawned by 'async'.
-- Asynchronous actions are run in a separate process, and
-- operations are provided for waiting for asynchronous actions to
-- complete and obtaining their results (see e.g. 'wait').
--
-- Handles of this type cannot cross remote boundaries. Furthermore, handles
-- of this type /must not/ be passed to functions in this module by processes
-- other than the caller of 'async' - that is, this module provides asynchronous
-- actions whose results are accessible *only* by the initiating process.
--
-- See 'async'
data AsyncChan a = AsyncChan {
    worker    :: AsyncRef
  , insulator :: AsyncRef
  , channel   :: (InternalChannel a)
  }

-- | Spawns an asynchronous action in a new process.
-- We ensure that if the caller's process exits, that the worker is killed.
-- Because an @AsyncChan@ can only be used by the initial caller's process, if
-- that process dies then the result (if any) is discarded. If a process other
-- than the initial caller attempts to obtain the result of an asynchronous
-- action, the behaviour is undefined. It is /highly likely/ that such a
-- process will block indefinitely, quite possible that such behaviour could lead
-- to deadlock and almost certain that resource starvation will occur. /Do Not/
-- share the handles returned by this function across multiple processes.
--
-- If you need to spawn an asynchronous operation whose handle can be shared by
-- multiple processes then use the 'AsyncSTM' module instead.
--
-- There is currently a contract for async workers, that they should
-- exit normally (i.e., they should not call the @exit@ or @kill@ with their own
-- 'ProcessId' nor use the @terminate@ primitive to cease functining), otherwise
-- the 'AsyncResult' will end up being @AsyncFailed DiedException@ instead of
-- containing the desired result.

-- | Cancel an asynchronous operation and wait for the cancellation to complete.
-- Because of the asynchronous nature of message passing, the instruction to
-- cancel will race with the asynchronous worker, so it is /entirely possible/
-- that the 'AsyncResult' returned will not necessarily be 'AsyncCancelled'. For
-- example, the worker may complete its task after this function is called, but
-- before the cancellation instruction is acted upon.
-- 
-- If you wish to stop an asychronous operation /immediately/ (with caveats) then
-- consider using 'cancelWith' or 'cancelKill' instead.
--
cancelWait :: (Serializable a) => AsyncChan a -> Process (AsyncResult a)
cancelWait hAsync = cancel hAsync >> wait hAsync

-- | Cancel an asynchronous operation immediately.
-- This operation is performed by sending an /exit signal/ to the asynchronous
-- worker, which leads to the following semantics:
--
-- 1. if the worker already completed, this function has no effect
-- 2. the worker might complete after this call, but before the signal arrives
-- 3. the worker might ignore the exit signal using @catchExit@
--
-- In case of (3), this function has no effect. You should use 'cancel'
-- if you need to guarantee that the asynchronous task is unable to ignore
-- the cancellation instruction.
--
-- You should also consider that when sending exit signals to a process, the
-- definition of 'immediately' is somewhat vague and a scheduler might take
-- time to handle the request, which can lead to situations similar to (1) as
-- listed above, if the scheduler to which the calling process' thread is bound
-- decides to GC whilst another scheduler on which the worker is running is able
-- to continue.    
--
-- See 'Control.Distributed.Process.exit'
